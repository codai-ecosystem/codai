# AIDE Core - Remaining Issues Resolution

## Completed Fixes

### 1. Structured Logging Integration

- ✅ Developed comprehensive `LoggerService` class with support for different log levels
- ✅ Added `createLogger()` utility function for creating category-specific loggers
- ✅ Replaced console.log/console.error with structured logging across all major components:
  - Service classes (GitHubService, VersionManager, PluginManager, etc.)
  - Agent classes (BuilderAgent, CodeAgent, etc.)
  - UI components (ConversationalInterface)
  - Memory system (ContextManager)
  - Maintained special cases for templates and code snippets

### 2. Builder Agent Refactoring

- ✅ Broke down large BuilderAgent (1600+ lines) into focused modules:
  - `ProjectBuilder` - Handles project building operations
  - `FileManager` - Handles file system operations
  - `TemplateGenerator` - Handles code template generation
  - `ServerManager` - Handles server management
  - Each class has its own responsibility and logger instance

### 3. Plugin Storage Implementation

- ✅ Implemented storage helper methods in PluginManager:
  - `getStorageKeys()` method for workspace and global state
  - `setStorageKeysForSync()` method for sync configuration
  - `getPluginDataDir()` helper method

### 4. Async Utilities Implementation

- ✅ Developed comprehensive async utilities:
  - `withTimeout()` for promise timeout wrapping
  - `withRetry()` with exponential backoff
  - `TimeoutError` custom error class
  - Added imports in appropriate places

### 5. Custom Error Types System

- ✅ Created error classification system in `errorTypes.ts`
- ✅ Integrated custom error types (e.g., FileSystemError) in relevant classes

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. ESLint Configuration

- ❌ Resolve ESLint version compatibility issue (need 9.0.0, have 8.57.1)
- Solution: Update ESLint or adjust plugin requirements

### 2. Integration Testing

- ❌ Comprehensive testing of new components
- ❌ Create tests for refactored services
- ❌ Verify all logging statements work as expected

### 3. BuilderAgent Integration

- ❌ Update BuilderAgent to use the new extracted services
- ❌ Remove duplicated code from BuilderAgent

### 4. Documentation Updates

- ❌ Update documentation to reflect new architecture
- ❌ Add JSDoc comments to new classes and methods
- ❌ Create architecture diagram showing component relationships
