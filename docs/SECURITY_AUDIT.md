# AIDE Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This report outlines security issues identified in the AIDE codebase and configurations, along with implemented fixes and recommendations for further improvements. Key findings include outdated dependencies with known vulnerabilities, insufficient environment configuration, and a need for improved security practices.

| @octokit/request         | RegEx Denial of Service                    | MODERATE | Fixed       |
| @octokit/plugin-paginate | RegEx Denial of Service                    | MODERATE | Fixed       |
| next                     | Information exposure in dev server         | LOW      | Fixed       |

### 2. Environment Security Issues

- Environment files (.env.example) lacked comprehensive security configuration options
- Missing CORS and API rate limiting configurations
- Insufficient secrets management instructions

### 3. Code Issues

- Deprecated libraries and modules in use
- Outdated Node.js engine requirements
- Potential build-time security risks

## Implemented Fixes

1. **Dependencies Updates**:
   - Added comprehensive package overrides to force-update vulnerable dependencies
   - Replaced deprecated `asar` package with official `@electron/asar`
   - Updated from old `glob@5.0.13` to newer `glob@9.3.5`
   - Updated `sinon` to a non-deprecated version

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Enhanced `.env.example` with comprehensive security configurations
   - Added API rate limiting options
   - Added documentation for proper secrets management
   - Included development-only settings with clear warnings

3. **Build Process**:
   - Added new npm scripts for security auditing
   - Added dependency updates script
   - Updated node engine requirements to >=20.0.0

## Recommendations for Further Improvement

1. **Implement Proper Secret Scanning**
   - Add pre-commit hooks for secret detection
   - Configure GitHub secret scanning for the repository

2. **Enable Dependency Analysis**
   - Set up Dependabot alerts for the repository
   - Implement regular dependency review schedule

3. **Enhance Authentication Security**
   - Review GitHub integration authentication flow
   - Implement proper token rotation and expiration
   - Add CSRF protection to API endpoints

4. **Code Security Review**
   - Conduct a thorough code security review, especially in authentication flows
   - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) for web interfaces
   - Review and strengthen WebView security policies in Electron app

5. **Security Testing**
   - Implement automated security testing in CI pipeline
   - Add penetration testing to release workflow

## Next Steps

1. Address native dependency build issues (`tree-sitter`)
2. Complete comprehensive security testing after fixes
3. Implement recommended security improvements according to priority
4. Establish regular security audit schedule (quarterly recommended)
