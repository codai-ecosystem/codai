# AIDE Project Creation Flow - Implementation Complete

## ‚úÖ Features Implemented

### Enhanced Conversational Interface

- **Interactive Project Creation Flow**: New UI with project type selection cards
- **Enhanced WebView**: Added CSS and JavaScript for better user experience
- **Message Handling**: Support for `startProjectFlow` and `selectProjectType` messages

### Project Creation Commands

- `aide.createProject` - Opens the conversational interface and starts project creation
- `aide.showProjectPreview` - Shows live preview of projects with automatic dev server detection

### Enhanced Agent System

- **PlannerAgent**: Enhanced with detailed project planning capabilities
  - Technology stack recommendations for each project type
  - Project structure templates
  - Implementation roadmaps
  - Timeline estimation

### Project Types Supported

1. **üåê Web Application** - React/Next.js with modern tooling
2. **üì± Mobile App** - React Native/Expo cross-platform
3. **üîå API Service** - Node.js with Express/Fastify
4. **üíª Desktop App** - Electron/Tauri applications
5. **‚ú® Custom Project** - User-defined requirements

### UI/UX Improvements

- **Project Selection Cards**: Interactive cards with hover effects
- **Modern Design**: VS Code theme integration
- **Responsive Layout**: Grid-based layout for project options
- **Visual Feedback**: Typing indicators and smooth transitions

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Command Execution**: User runs `aide.createProject` command
2. **Interface Opening**: Conversational interface opens with project options
3. **Project Selection**: User clicks on desired project type card
4. **Agent Processing**: PlannerAgent analyzes selection and provides detailed plan
5. **Next Steps**: Agent suggests technology choices and implementation steps

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Key Files Modified/Created

- `src/ui/conversationalInterface.ts` - Added project creation flow
- `src/agents/plannerAgent.ts` - Enhanced with project planning capabilities
- `package.json` - Added new commands and updated dependencies

### Memory Integration

- Project selections stored in memory graph as 'decision' nodes
- Project plans stored as 'feature' nodes
- Relationships tracked for context awareness

### Agent Coordination

- PlannerAgent handles initial project analysis
- AgentManager coordinates responses
- Future integration with BuilderAgent for actual project creation

## üìã Next Steps (Future Development)

1. **BuilderAgent Enhancement**: Implement actual project scaffolding
2. **File Generation**: Create project files based on templates
3. **GitHub Integration**: Repository creation and initial commit
4. **CI/CD Setup**: Automatic deployment configuration
5. **Testing Integration**: Automated test setup for projects

## üéØ User Experience

The enhanced project creation flow provides:

- **Visual Project Selection**: Clear, attractive project type cards
- **Detailed Planning**: Comprehensive project plans with technology recommendations
- **Interactive Flow**: Smooth progression from selection to implementation
- **Memory Persistence**: All decisions tracked for future reference
- **Agent Coordination**: Multiple AI agents working together

This implementation completes Phase 3 (Interface & User Experience) of the AIDE development plan and provides a solid foundation for Phase 4 (GitHub Integration) features.
