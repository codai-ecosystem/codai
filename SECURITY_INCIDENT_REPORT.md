**Status**: REMEDIATED  

## Summary

GitHub Security Alert detected exposed secrets in the dragoscv/AIDE repository. The following credentials were publicly accessible:

1. **Google Cloud Service Account Credentials**
   - File: `secrets/aide-dev-461602-37d8be2d8a83.json`
   - Service Account: `aide-deployer@aide-dev-461602.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
   - Key ID: `37d8be2d8a8379f4857ee6e6b468b65226d64916`
   - Commit: `af164bd6`

2. **Highnote SK Test Key**
   - File: `scripts/setup-vercel-env.sh` (line 20)
   - Commit: `56d870e8`

3. **Additional Stripe Test Keys**
   - Found in multiple setup scripts
   - Pattern: `pk_test_*` and `sk_test_*`

## Google Cloud Platform Response

Google Cloud detected the exposure and took immediate action:
- Service Account key was disabled
- GCP Case #60327692 was opened
- Resources associated with project `aide-dev-461602` are being restricted

## Immediate Actions Taken

### 1. Repository Cleanup ✅
- [x] Removed `secrets/aide-dev-461602-37d8be2d8a83.json`
- [x] Removed `secrets/aide-github-app.2025-05-31.private-key.pem`
- [x] Replaced actual Stripe test keys with placeholders in:
  - `scripts/setup-vercel-env.sh`
  - `scripts/setup-vercel-env.ps1`
  - `scripts/setup-vercel-env.bat`

### 2. Enhanced Security Measures ✅
- [x] Updated `.gitignore` with comprehensive secret pattern protection
- [x] Added patterns for:
  - Service account files (`*-service-account.json`, `*-credentials.json`)
  - API keys (`*api-key*`, `*secret-key*`)
  - SSH keys (`id_rsa*`, `*.ssh`)
  - SSL certificates (`*.crt`, `*.cert`)
  - OAuth configs (`oauth-*.json`, `client-secret*.json`)

## Required Follow-up Actions

### URGENT - Within 24 Hours ⚠️
- [ ] **Rotate Google Cloud Service Account Key**
  - Access Google Cloud Console for project `aide-dev-461602`
  - Generate new service account key for `aide-deployer@aide-dev-461602.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
  - Update deployment systems with new credentials
  - Store new credentials securely (environment variables, not files)

- [ ] **Review Google Cloud Activity**
  - Login to Google Cloud Console
  - Review activity logs for any unauthorized access
  - Check billing for unexpected charges
  - Review IAM permissions and access

- [ ] **Audit Repository History**
  - Use tools like `git-secrets` or `truffleHog` to scan entire git history
  - Consider using `git filter-branch` to remove secrets from history if needed
  - Review all commits that touched the `secrets/` directory

### Within 1 Week
- [ ] **Implement Secrets Management**
  - Set up proper secrets management (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.)
  - Configure CI/CD to use secure secret injection
  - Remove all hardcoded secrets from codebase

- [ ] **Security Audit**
  - Conduct full security audit of the codebase
  - Implement pre-commit hooks to prevent secret commits
  - Set up automated secret scanning in CI/CD pipeline

- [ ] **Team Training**
  - Brief team on secure coding practices
  - Establish guidelines for handling secrets and credentials
  - Implement code review processes for security

## Prevention Measures Implemented

1. **Enhanced .gitignore**: Comprehensive patterns to catch common secret files
2. **Placeholder Values**: Replaced all actual keys with clear placeholder text
3. **Documentation**: Clear security incident response process

## Monitoring and Detection

- GitHub Security Alerts are enabled
- Consider implementing additional tools:
  - GitGuardian for continuous monitoring
  - pre-commit hooks with `detect-secrets`
  - CI/CD security scanning

## Lessons Learned

1. Never commit actual credentials, even test keys
2. Use environment variables and secure secret management systems
3. Implement automated secret detection before commits reach remote repositories
4. Regular security audits are essential
