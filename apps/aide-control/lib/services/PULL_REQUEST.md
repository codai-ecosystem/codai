# Firebase Provisioning Service Improvements

## What does this PR do?

This PR enhances the Firebase Provisioning Service with improved error handling, code organization, security, and type safety. It separates mock implementations from the main code, adds explicit typings, provides better validation across all methods, and adds comprehensive test coverage using Vitest.

## Why is it needed?

The original implementation had several issues:

- Excessive use of magic strings for API endpoints
- Inconsistent error handling across methods
- Mock implementation mixed with production code
- Limited type safety and validation
- Insufficient documentation for testing and configuration
- Tests using Jest instead of Vitest (project standard)
- Incomplete test coverage for critical methods

These improvements align the code with VS Code coding guidelines and best practices, making it more maintainable, secure, and easier to test.

## How was it tested?

- Updated tests from Jest to Vitest format
- Added comprehensive test coverage for all service methods
- Verified all code compiles without errors
- Manually inspected all modified methods
- Checked for type safety with TypeScript compiler
- Confirmed proper error handling patterns
- Added documentation with examples for testing
- Created test fixtures and mocks for consistent testing

## Changes include:

1. **Code organization improvements**
   - Extracted API endpoint URLs as constants
   - Moved mock Google Auth implementation to a separate file
   - Added explicit result type interfaces

2. **Error handling enhancements**
   - Improved error reporting with context in all methods
   - Better validation and error collection in API enabling
   - Added cleanup on partial failures

3. **Security improvements**
   - Enhanced API key creation with configurable origins
   - Better validation of service configuration

4. **Performance optimizations**
   - Improved waiting strategy with exponential backoff

5. **Documentation**
   - Added example test configuration
   - Created environment variable example
   - Added comprehensive JSDocs
   - Updated README with usage examples and best practices

6. **Testing Improvements**
   - Migrated tests from Jest to Vitest format
   - Added tests for all public and private methods
   - Created test examples for integration testing
   - Added comprehensive test coverage for error handling paths
   - Provided test configuration examples
