## Pending Tasks

### Type Definitions and Dependencies

- Resolve workspace dependency issues with `firebase-admin`
- Add proper types for Auth context and API responses

### Additional API Routes

- Complete the API routes for user billing management
- Implement webhook handlers for Stripe events
- Add API routes for analytics and monitoring

### Frontend Updates

- Update UI components to use the new API client
- Add proper error handling and form validation
- Implement data fetching with React Query
- Enhance admin dashboard with usage visualizations
- Add configuration UI for the dual-mode infrastructure

### Deployment and Testing

- Create automated tests for API routes
- Implement end-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Set up CI/CD for the control panel
- Add proper logging and monitoring

## Migration Strategy

For the transition to the dual-mode infrastructure:

1. Define a clear database schema for service configurations
2. Implement seamless switching between managed and self-managed modes
3. Create migration scripts for existing users
4. Add monitoring for service usage and quota management
